* Bangumi RSS
Bangumi RSS is a CLI tool to subscript bangumi with rss. It focus on building a workflow to auto-download bangumi(especially in Raw) on a server.

** Feature
*** Bangumi RSS
- Subscribe/unsubscribe bangumi using rss
- Support RSS feed in this format:
#+BEGIN_SRC xml
  <item>
    <title>bangumi name</title>
    <link>bangumi download link</link>
  </item>
#+END_SRC
- List all bangumi or details of given bangumi
- Auto send new feeds to Aria2
- Scheduled job to check new feeds with cron format instructions
 
It works almost the same as below IFTTT workflow:
*If new feeds found, then make a HTTP request with Aria2 RPC interface*
*** Aria2 Dropbox(Optional)
- If new download task finished in Aria2, then upload it to dropbox

It is a substitute for btsync because in China, dropbox works quite well with proxy.
